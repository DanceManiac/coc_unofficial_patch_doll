		<text>I'm the conductor, I drive back and forth for a modest fee. They call me Navigator. Basically, greenery, of course, uses services, but experienced stalkers do not neglect. The deal is this: you pay, I leave you at the designated area and come back. There are several places that are worthy of your attention: Amber, Swamps, Landfill, army depots, a base on the Perimeter and the Yanov station in the vicinity of Jupiter.</text>

			<text>I am ready to share with you information about the Swamp Doctor for seven thousand.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bar_visitors_informator_buy_information_6">
			<text>Let's go.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bar_visitors_informator_buy_information_11">
			<text>The old man is now in the Swamps, waiting for his friend-the Shooter. Recently, some guy came to him, to whom the Doctor told his story and, importantly, the story of the Strelka group itself! You can personally go to him and make sure.</text>
		</string>

		<string id="bar_visitors_informator_buy_information_2">
			<text>There is information about a strange stalker who is looking for a group of Gunmen for ten thousand.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bar_visitors_informator_buy_information_7">
			<text>Let's go.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bar_visitors_informator_buy_information_12">
			<text>This same stalker who went to the Doctor is now looking for traces of the Shooter's group. He has already explored laboratories in the Dark Valley and on Amber and is clearly not going to stop there. Judging by verified sources, he wants to break into the center of the Zone and finish what the aforementioned group of stalkers could not for one reason or another.</text>
		</string>

		<string id="bar_visitors_informator_buy_information_3">
			<text>I have information that sheds light on the second shutdown of the Burner for fifteen thousand.</text>

			<text>Let's go.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bar_visitors_informator_buy_information_13">
			<text>It's still the same stalker and he turns off the Scorcher! I wonder when they will guess to somehow harm the control panel, and not jerk off the switch every time? There are rumors that now he is going to Pripyat and he had some kind of assignment from the Doctor. I don't know if the old man wants to find his friend in this way or if there is something more hidden behind it.</text>

		<string id="bar_visitors_informator_buy_information_4">
			<text>I have information about the adventures of a mysterious stalker on Generators for twenty-four thousand.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bar_visitors_informator_buy_information_9">
			<text>Let's go.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="bar_visitors_informator_buy_information_14">
			<text>Have you ever heard of Generators? Until recently, this place was considered only a myth, but after the second trip of the Strelka group to the center of the Zone, all doubts were dispelled. There are persistent disputes about what is there, but old satellite images indicate some kind of strange infrastructure, after which this place was named. Apparently, both the Monolith grouping and all important processes on the territory of the Zone are controlled from there. So our stalker has already gone there and I think he is serious, probably his intervention can lead to serious changes in the Zone, the leaders of some groups have already expressed their dissatisfaction with this information.</text>

<!-- Arena -->

	<string id="bar_arena_man_job_0">
		<text>Who do you have for me to fight?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_man_job_11">
		<text>So, your first fight? Your opponent is a piece of meat just like you. He's here because of his debts and he only has two options: to come out and fight, or to land himself in the nearest anomaly. He's gonna fight like a cornered animal. Equipment for today... Lemme think... How about you two use basic pistols, two boxes of ammo should be plenty. Either kick his ass or we feed you to the dogs - not much of a choice. Go on now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_man_job_111">
		<text>I'm ready.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_man_job_112">
		<text>I'm not ready.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_man_job_12">
		<text>Your last fight didn't mean shit, you're still the same piece of meat you were before and no self-respecting person will bet a single mag on you. If you wanna earn some proper cash you're gonna have to make a few more appearances in the arena. Your new opponent also got through the first round, and his fight was a lot harder than yours. I don't like him, to be honest - he kills too quickly and the crowd doesn't like that. So, go and show us what you can do! The stakes will increase after this fight - all you gotta do is stay alive. Move it!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_man_job_121">
		<text>I'm ready.</text>

	<string id="bar_arena_man_job_122">
		<text>I'm not ready.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_man_job_13">
		<text>Well, well... You're not as much of a pussy as you first seemed. Now it's time to test you out in a real fight. You're up against two guys. The first one's called Swede and I don't remember the second one's name. They were paired up intentionally as they hate each other's guts so don't worry about them working as a team - they're more likely to shoot each other. Today is shotgun day so don't let them get too close or we'll have to pick you up piece by piece. The odds are 10:1 so if you win you'll make a fair amount. Off you go!</text>

	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_man_job_14">
		<text>Well, now I can safely say that you're a fighter, a real fighter. Now it's time for a team fight. You get to fight with two rookies - two brothers - on your side. They haven't fought yet but they're brothers, so I had to put them into a team fight. I wouldn't expect any real help from them if I were you. You're fighting an experienced team, they're contenders for the final this season. A dangerous lot. They use different weapons but one has an automatic shotgun - be very careful with him. Good luck, pal... You're gonna need it.</text>

	<string id="bar_arena_man_job_15">
		<text>You've got a special fight today. Even the army has heard about you! Don't be surprised, they fight here too - there's even a general in the crowd. These guys are from the Spetsnaz or OMON. They're well armed and their armour is as good as you'd expect. Don't worry though, I ain't gonna leave you out in the rain, either. You'll get a vest used by Freedom - it's light so it won't slow you down. Go on, show them that stalkers ain't no whipping boys. Good luck!</text>

		<text>Time for you to show what you can do. Duty captured a group of bandits that had been causing problems for stalkers near Rostok. Duty took 'em at night so most of the bandits were taken alive. They were all gonna be executed anyway so I convinced Duty to give them a chance. If any of them survive, they'll go in the can outside the Zone, which is better than dying here. They're not well-armed - probably just a few pistols and sawn-offs - but there's six of them so watch yourself. Go on now!</text>

		<text>Well, you're almost in the final. Now you'll be fighting a real stalker. He's alone but he's got an assault rifle and he's inside an exoskeleton. Catch one burst and you're toast. There will be a surprise that I can't tell you about too... Here's my advice: be prepared, it's gonna be tough. The winner makes it through to the final. Fight to the death, go!</text>

		<text>Congratulations, you're in the final! One more to go and this one is to the death, every man for himself. There will be 4 other stalkers in the arena: all real pros in exoskeletons but it's a fair deal this time - you'll get exactly what they have. The only thing is, you don't get medkits or bandages in a fight to the death. Ready? Go prove you're the best, GO!</text>

		<text>How do you get the mutants here?</text>

	<string id="bar_arena_manager_rules_0">
		<text>What are the rules?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_rules_1">
		<text>Oh, the rules are pretty simple. I invented them myself. For challenges, there's a cage, and a mutant is let inside the cage. You pay money and tell me the time you need to kill the monster. If you make it - you win, if you don't - I win.\nBut for the main course, bandits and the Zone's other degenerates captured by Duty fight in the arena for their crimes. Some are just stalkers who fancy a fight, and not actually criminals, but whoever leaves the arena in the least amount of pieces gets a sizeable reward. If they keep on winning fights, then more stalkers will come to watch, and the combatants win larger rewards.</text>

	<string id="bar_arena_manager_start_11">
		<text>Good to see you stalker, welcome to the arena.</text>

	<string id="bar_arena_manager_start_31">
		<text>Sorry, there's nothing to fight against yet. Wait for a day or two until we can catch a new mutant.</text>
